== Preface

We wrote this book for data scientists and data engineers familiar with Python and pandas looking to handle larger-scale problems than their current tooling allows. Current PySpark users will find some of this material to overlap with their existing knowledge of PySpark, but we hope they still find it helpful and not just for getting away from the JVM.

If you are not familiar with Python, some excellent O'Reilly titles include _Learning Python_ and _Python for Data Analysis_. If you and your team are more of a JVM language person (such as Java or Scala), while we are a bit biased, we'd encourage you to check out Apache Spark along with _Learning Spark_ and _High Performance Spark_.

This book is primarily focused on data science and related tasks because, in our opinion, that is where Dask excels the most. If you have a more general problem that Dask does not seem to be quite the right fit for, we'd (with a bit of bias again) encourage you to check out _Scaling Python with Ray_, which has less of a data science focus.

=== Acknowledgments

This is a book written by two trans immigrants living in America at a time when the walls can feel like they’re closing in. We choose to dedicate this book to those fighting for a more just world in whichever way, however small, thank you. To all those we lost or didn’t get to meet, we miss you. To those we have yet to meet, we are excited to meet you.

This book would not exist if not for the communities it is built on. From the Dask community to the PyData community, thank you. Thank you for your contributions and guidance to all the early readers and reviewers. These reviewers include Ruben Berenguel, Tom Drabas, Adam Breindel, Kevin Kho, John Iannone, Joseph Gnanaprakasam, Jess Males, and many more. A special thanks to Ann Spencer for reviewing the early proposals of what eventually became this and Scaling Python with Ray. Any remaining mistakes are entirely our fault, sometimes against reviewers' advice.footnote:[We are sometimes stubborn to a fault.]

Holden would also like to thank her wife and partners for putting up with her long in-the-bath-tub writing sessions. A special thank you to Timbit for guarding the house and generally giving Holden a reason to get out of bed (albeit often a bit too early for her taste).

Mika would additionally like to thank Holden for her mentorship and help, and shoutout to her colleagues at Harvard Data Science department for providing her with unlimited free coffee.

=== A Note on Responsibility

As the saying goes, with great power comes great responsibility. Dask, and tools like it, enable you to process more data and build more complex models. It's essential not to get too excited and carried away with collecting data simply for the sake of it, and stop to ask yourself if including a new field in your model might have some unintended real-world implications. You don't have to search very hard to find stories of well-meaning engineers and data scientists accidentally building models or tools that caused devastating impacts, like increased auditing of minorities, hiring algorithms that discriminate based on gender, or subtler things like biases in word embeddings. Please use your newfound powers keeping this in mind, for one never wants to end up in a textbook for the wrong reasons.

=== Code Examples

The https://github.com/scalingpythonml/scalingpythonml[+++Scaling Python ML Github+++] contains the majority of the examples in this book. They are mainly under the "dask" directory but with more esoteric parts (such as the cross-platform CUDA container) in separate top-level directories.

This book is here to help you get your job done. In general, if an example code is offered with this book, you may use it in your programs and documentation. You do not need to contact O'Reilly for permission unless you’re reproducing a significant portion of the code. For example, writing a program that uses several chunks of code from this book does not require permission. Selling or distributing a CD-ROM of examples from O’Reilly books does require permission. Answering a question by citing this book and quoting example code does not require permission. The code is also available under an Apache 2 License. Incorporating a significant amount of example code from this book into your product’s documentation may require permission.
