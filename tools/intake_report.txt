Resources
=================
* Figs: Illustrations is still working on the figs.
** 17 total. (1 is informal; 0 are inline.)
** I left the draft_images/ and figures/ folders in the repo for reference, but they are not used, all the images in the build are in the images/ folder.

** Once the figs are processed on /work, you'll need to add them to the book's repo.
** A report mapping original figure file names to their new names can be found in the tools folder for this project as figure_renaming_report.tsv.

* Intake Report:(Atlas repo) tools/intakereport.txt

* MS Snapshot: To view the submitted files, checkout the git tag named 'manuscript_to_prod' by running the following command:

$ git checkout manuscript_to_prod

This will temporarily switch the files in your repo to the state they were in when the manuscript_to_prod tag was created. To switch the files back to the current state, run: 

$ git checkout main 

 Notes from Tools:
=================

* PROD: Add any authors to the project that need to be added.

* Syntax highlighting: applied to 105 out of 106 code listings.

* In Ch.9 there is a hard-coded ref to 'Chapter 13' (which doesn't exist).

* I was only able to find an obvious target id for a couple of the broken xrefs. The remaining ones are: 
ch02.asciidoc - line 10:  appa_deploy

* Please let Tools know ASAP if there are any other global problems for which we can help automate a fix.
